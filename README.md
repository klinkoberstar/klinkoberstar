# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kathryn Link-Oberstar (She/Her)

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a graduate student in Computational Analysis and Public Policy @ the University of Chicago. 

I am interested in blending data science with public policy to drive social change, focusing on areas like climate action, hunger relief, and equitable urban development!

- ðŸŒ± As a student, Iâ€™m deepening my expertise in machine learning, data management, and the practical application of data science to policy and social change.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my experiences with implementing data-driven solutions in public policy, my advocacy work, or anything related to the intersection of technology and social good.

## Here are some of the projects I've worked on lately:

- [Climate Conversations (March 2024)](https://github.com/ehabich/climate-conversations): This project aims to improve how policymakers communicate about climate change by using data from Reddit discussions and academic journals. It develops a toolkit to help align policy communication with public concerns and scientific evidence, using topic modeling to identify key themes in Reddit conversations and applying moral foundations theory for effective messaging. The research also simplifies scientific findings into summaries for policymakers, facilitating a deeper understanding of public and scientific views on climate change. By combining natural language processing (NLP) and moral foundations analysis, the project offers innovative ways to tackle communication challenges in climate change policy, showing how computational tools can enhance policy development and communication.

- Portland Rank Choice Voting Simulation (March 2024): With Moon Duchin and the MGGG Redistricting Lab, this study explores the impact of Portland's new proportional rank choice voting system on city council elections set for November 2024. It simulates various voter behaviors, considering ideological and demographic loyalties, candidate numbers, and group cohesion. Focusing on two main scenarios involving POC and white voters, and a detailed analysis including white progressives and moderates, the study uses MGGG's Votekit Package to predict outcomes based on voter dynamics. It aims to provide insights for strategic campaigning and enhancing POC candidates' performance, highlighting the importance of the number of POC candidates and white progressive voter preferences.

- [Postgrad Job Search (January 2024)](https://github.com/klinkoberstar/postgrad-job-search) [IN PROGRESS]
  
- [Pedal Pals (December 2023)](https://github.com/klinkoberstar/pedal_pals): We investigated distribution drift in Divvy bike ridership from 2014 to 2019 using a random sample of one million trips. Our analysis showed a significant change in trip duration patterns, particularly in the summer months between 2014-2017 and 2018-2019. We applied machine learning models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) to forecast trip durations, assessing their accuracy with Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The MLP model outperformed others, effectively handling complex data and adapting to non-linear distribution changes, underscoring the need to consider temporal shifts in data when building predictive models.

- [Watts Up CA (December 2023)](https://github.com/meganhmoore/watts-up-ca): This project is a comprehensive study on California's electricity consumption and forecasting, highlighting the state's high overall but low per capita energy use amidst a push for 100% renewable energy by 2040. This project utilized data from January 1990 to June 2023 to explore the evolving dynamics of residential electricity usage against the backdrop of ambitious environmental and energy policies. Through detailed exploratory analysis and the application of time series analysis and forecasting techniques, the team investigated the impact of weather, demand-supply factors, and policy changes on energy consumption trends. The study not only identified significant predictors of energy use but also outlined the complexity of forecasting in the face of changing trends, multiple seasonalities, and non-linear relationships

- Deconflict Analysis - Deconflict Committee Scheduler Data Extraction, Database Creation, and Analysis (Summer 2023): Deconflict Analysis provides data extraction, storage, analysis, and reporting capabilities for the Deconflict Committee Scheduler tool. It offers real-time reports on tool usage, drafting activity, and trending meeting conflicts. In January 2019, the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress (SCMC) was founded to enhance the effectiveness, efficiency, and transparency of Congress. They proposed a unified committee calendar portal to ease scheduling and diminish overlaps. Following this, the House Digital Service (HDS) was initiated in 2022 and developed the Committee Scheduler Deconflict tool, a solution for the SCMC's recommendation. Launched in March 2023 and broadly available by May 2023, this tool offers a centralized platform for committee scheduling, aiming to minimize conflicts. When the tool was created it did not include any data collection or analysis integrated into the backend. This project introduced data-collection and analysis for this new tool.
